  - Guid: afc246d8-92ba-4300-b23a-5c6f738bf59e
    DialogueText: How disheartening. Perhaps she's catching onto me. She's probably
      shaking in her boots, cowering in fear! She knows change is in the air.
    Position: {x: 1020, y: 127}
  - Guid: 84a11354-fef7-4475-9448-838741c8157f

      everyone will know of their corruption.'

  - Guid: 4f4cf48f-7658-4d70-8de1-5884630c93cd

      them! The only dangerous thing I've ever done is work for the cultist-barons
      who own everything.

      otherwise she wouldn't slander me. You can't trust anyone in this town. You
      need to be careful!
    Position: {x: 4953, y: 129}
  - Guid: befc9127-e937-4482-bcc3-fc1ce6527982
