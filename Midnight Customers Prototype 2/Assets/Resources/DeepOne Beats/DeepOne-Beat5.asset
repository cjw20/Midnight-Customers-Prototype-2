      even our last one. I hope you understand why this is all so important to me
      now.

    DialogueText: You cannot know how much it means to hear you say that. There may
      yet be hope for this wretched place to change. Speaking of change, have you
      heard anything about Helen Maxwell?
    Position: {x: 1228, y: 141}
  - Guid: 7ee33d07-2bfb-4b45-a06c-520485ce9d5b
    DialogueText: Your privilege affords you that perspective. I envy those who can
      live their lives divorced from the horrors of oppression. Speaking of oppression,
      have you heard anything about Helen Maxwell?

    DialogueText: I ask because I found documents proving she's the cult's leader.
      That she owns the politicians, businesses, and factories. This proves that
      she made the laws which killed my family, and others.

  - Guid: 31b3e536-0c7b-4990-b1b0-7dd06e0cb3ab
    DialogueText: It's likely you have, actually. I found documents proving she's
      the cult's leader. That she owns the politicians, businesses, and factories.
      This proves that she made the laws which killed my family, and others.
    Position: {x: 2463, y: 141}
  - Guid: 53f44e21-64d7-44b8-8b5e-aeaf53c39445
    DialogueText: That's what the evidence shows. My evidence also indicates that
      she will soon take part in a ritual to make herself more powerful, here at
      the gas station. I am sorry to ask this of you, but I need your help to stop
      her.
    Position: {x: 3773, y: 147}
  - Guid: e00ecede-46c3-46ca-8e5a-7b176e28b55c
    DialogueText: I'm glad you asked. My evidence indicates that she will soon take
      part in a ritual to make herself more powerful, here at the gas station. I
      am sorry to ask this of you, but I need your help to stop her.
    Position: {x: 3775, y: 279}
  - Guid: 396043ae-e897-405e-8e31-0f64434ff92c
    DialogueText: When she comes here, you'll call me. I have organized with other
      victims of Maxwell's greed; now we have a plan to remove the cult from power.
      It's time to end this era of pain and degredation.
    Position: {x: 5144, y: 148}
  - Guid: 05363f69-f528-4c31-aa3c-d428f13eba1f
    DialogueText: Too many people have died for you to be on the fence. When she
      arrives, you must call me. I have a plan to remove the cult from power. It's
      time to end this era of degredation, at last.
    Position: {x: 5143, y: 279}
  - Guid: abb544ac-edb3-4398-8ade-d719c5d3e3c8
    DialogueText: Think of the people who came before you, who were never given this
      choice. What do you think they would've wanted? What do you think my family
      would've wanted? I'll leave my number here. Do the right thing.
